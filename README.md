## Project Name: Pay Ya Bills
This project is just a demo for an app that I am continuing to make for my Mother. I made the app very simple to use so that people who don't know english can have their children set up the bills so that parents can easily get to a bill payment page in order to pay a bill and keep track of past bills and future bills that need to be paid.

## Setup
This project was done using HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Rails. The framework used in this project is Foundation 5.

## How to Use
To use this app someone needs to create a bunch of different bills that will appear on the index page by using the add bill button. Then on the index page A user can click on link that takes them to the company of that bill's website. Then when the user finishes paying that bill they must return to the website and click on the bill name and on the show page must select that they paid the bill. After this the bill will not change values in the database and will be able to be shown on paid history. There a user can go on and see a history of bills that they paid.
